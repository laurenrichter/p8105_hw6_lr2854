## Problem 1

In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the
effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight. This dataset,
available here, consists of roughly 4000 children and includes the
following variables:

-   `babysex`: baby’s sex (male = 1, female = 2)
-   `bhead`: baby’s head circumference at birth (centimeters)
-   `blength`: baby’s length at birth (centimeteres)
-   `bwt`: baby’s birth weight (grams)
-   `delwt`: mother’s weight at delivery (pounds)
-   `fincome`: family monthly income (in hundreds, rounded)
-   `frace`: father’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto
    Rican, 8 = Other, 9 = Unknown)
-   `gaweeks`: gestational age in weeks
-   `malform`: presence of malformations that could affect weight (0 =
    absent, 1 = present)
-   `menarche`: mother’s age at menarche (years)
-   `mheigth`: mother’s height (inches)
-   `momage`: mother’s age at delivery (years)
-   `mrace`: mother’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto
    Rican, 8 = Other)
-   `parity`: number of live births prior to this pregnancy
-   `pnumlbw`: previous number of low birth weight babies
-   `pnumgsa`: number of prior small for gestational age babies
-   `ppbmi`: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI
-   `ppwt`: mother’s pre-pregnancy weight (pounds)
-   `smoken`: average number of cigarettes smoked per day during
    pregnancy
-   `wtgain`: mother’s weight gain during pregnancy (pounds)

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

``` r
bw_data = read_csv("data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names("snake") %>%
  mutate(babysex = as_factor(babysex),
         frace = as_factor(frace), 
         mrace = as_factor(mrace))
## Rows: 4342 Columns: 20
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## dbl (20): babysex, bhead, blength, bwt, delwt, fincome, frace, gaweeks, malf...

## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
# check for the number of missing variables using sum(is.na(bw_data))
```

Data tidying involved name cleaning, variable conversion, and checking
for missing data. Variable names were cleaned to ensure they were
consistent (using snake case, although because of the initial formatting
of variables, snake case resulted only in lowercase variable names sans
underscores). The variables `babysex`,`frace`, and `mrace` were
converted from numeric to factor variables. There were 0 missing
variables in the dataset.

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these Make
this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use
crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.
