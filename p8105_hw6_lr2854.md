## Problem 1

In this problem, you will analyze data gathered to understand the
effects of several variables on a child’s birthweight. This dataset,
available here, consists of roughly 4000 children and includes the
following variables:

`babysex`: baby’s sex (male = 1, female = 2) bhead: baby’s head
circumference at birth (centimeters) blength: baby’s length at birth
(centimeteres) bwt: baby’s birth weight (grams) delwt: mother’s weight
at delivery (pounds) fincome: family monthly income (in hundreds,
rounded) frace: father’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 =
Puerto Rican, 8 = Other, 9 = Unknown) gaweeks: gestational age in weeks
malform: presence of malformations that could affect weight (0 = absent,
1 = present) menarche: mother’s age at menarche (years) mheigth:
mother’s height (inches) momage: mother’s age at delivery (years) mrace:
mother’s race (1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Asian, 4 = Puerto Rican, 8 =
Other) parity: number of live births prior to this pregnancy pnumlbw:
previous number of low birth weight babies pnumgsa: number of prior
small for gestational age babies ppbmi: mother’s pre-pregnancy BMI ppwt:
mother’s pre-pregnancy weight (pounds) smoken: average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy wtgain: mother’s weight gain
during pregnancy (pounds) Load and clean the data for regression
analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for
missing data, etc.).

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add\_predictions and add\_residuals in
making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these Make
this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use
crossv\_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.
